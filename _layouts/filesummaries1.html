			LD_Decay: <br>
		</div>
		- A file that has the average correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) between two SNP across a range of distances. The average was generated by moving across the genome in 10 Mb blocks 
		and randomly grabbing two SNP and calculating their respective (r<sup>2</sup>) and placing them in the correct bins based how far they were apart. Within a block 500 pairs of 
		SNP are randomly sampled and once finished the window is shifted by 5 Mb and is repeated until the end of the chromosome. This is conducted within each chromosome. The 
		distances are in the first row and are in Kilobases. Each row after the first row corresponds to the generation, such that line 2 is generation 0, line 3 is generation 1, etc. 
		The formula to calculate the D and (r2) values is below and the subscript refers to either SNP marker 1 or 2. <br>

			QTL_LD_Decay: <br>
		</div>
		- Similar to the "LD Decay" file this file estimates the average correlation between a SNP and a QTL within window sizes of 0-0.5 Mb, 0.5-1.0 Mb, 1.0-1.5 Mb, 1.5-2.0 Mb and 2.0-2.5 Mb. 
		For example if a SNP and QTL were 0.75 Mb apart it would get placed in the 0.5 - 1.0 Mb bin. Each line in the file represents a QTL. If the correlation could not be estimated due to 
		lack of SNP in the window or if SNP are near fixation a ’-5’ will be produced. The first column represents the chromosome and the second column represents the position in Mb. The last 
		column is the average correlation within a generation across the different window sizes. Correlations within a generation across windows are separated by a ":" and sets of correlations 
		across generations are seperated by a "_". <br>

		2.0-2.5 Mb. The first column is the generation and the columns following would be the correlation between the current generation and preceding generations. <br>
