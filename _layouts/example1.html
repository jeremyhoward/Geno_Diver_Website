	 		&emsp; At the current time executable files are available only for Linux operating environments and are located on the GitHub page for
	 		<a href="https://github.com/jeremyhoward/Geno-Diver">Geno-Diver</a>. To run the program place, "GenoDiver", "macs" and "msformatter"
	 		 executable files in the folder where the program will run. Before running the program, the file permission need to be checked.
	 		 After verifying the permissions, a parameter file that is outlined below will need to be generated and placed in the same folder 
	 		 as the previous three executable files. A parameter file can be generated using any text editor or downloaded from the
	 		  <a href="https://github.com/jeremyhoward/Geno-Diver">Geno-Diver</a> GitHub page.

			&emsp; The simulation program reads the parameter file by searching for keywords that are capitalized and then followed by a colon. Therefore any
			phrase that does not meet the search criteria is ignored when initializing parameters within the program. Also, if you want to comment out a
			parameter just add "!!" within the key word and the program will skip over it. For example to skip over the "SEED" parameter just replace it with 
			"SE!!ED" and it won't recognize the parameter any more. <br> <br>
			&emsp; To run the program type “./GenoDiver” and then the name of your parameter file. So for example, if the parameter file is named “parameterfile”
			then to run the program type “./GenoDiver parameterfile”. During the simulation, the program outputs minimal comments on the progress. A more
			 thorough description of the status of the program is printed to the log file (i.e. “log_file.txt”). <br> <br>
			&emsp; After the program has finished it is a strongly recommended to check the parameters initialized at the top of the log file within
			the output folder. The log file contains a large amount of information and is a great tool to ensure that the parameters and outcome
			 of the simulation is what is intended. If the program is not running correctly the log file should provide knowledge on why and
			  where the simulation crashed or exited.
